Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa and VADER
This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using RoBERTa (a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model) and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

Overview
Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on analyzing the sentiment of Amazon reviews. We utilize two different approaches:

RoBERTa: RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) is a transformer-based language model trained on large-scale corpora. We fine-tune RoBERTa for sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews.

VADER: VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing social media text. It provides a quick and simple way to assess the sentiment of text based on a set of predefined rules.
